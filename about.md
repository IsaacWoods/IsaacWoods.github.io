Hi! I'm Isaac, a medical student from the UK, interested in systems programming, especially in Rust.

My main project is [Pebble](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/pebble), a kernel and userspace written in Rust to
explore modern ideas about operating systems. It is still in its early stages, but I'm excited to see where it
goes.

I'm a member of the [Rust OSDev](https://github.com/rust-osdev) organisation, where I host the [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)
and [`pci_types`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/pci_types) crates, and contribute to some other projects.

I also dabble in programming languages, (very) amateur mathematics, firmware, and some other stuff.
