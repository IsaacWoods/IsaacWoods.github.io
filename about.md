I'm a 18 year-old student from the UK, interested in low-level programming, especially in Rust.

### OS Development
My main project is [Pebble](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/pebble), which is still in its very early stages. Pebble is built around a microkernel that places message passing front-and-center. Passing messages
replaces system calls, signals, and many of the ways UNIXs use files. I'm not going to have a lot of time to contribute to it in the near future, but I'm excited to see where it goes nevertheless.

I'm also a member of the [Rust OSDev](https://github.com/rust-osdev) organisation, where I host the [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi) library, and also contribute to some other projects.

### Teensy keyboard firmware
My side project at the moment is [teensy-kbd](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/teensy_kbd), a firmware for mechanical keyboards using the Teensy 3.2. It's also written in Rust, and is not yet very functional.

### Programming languages
I also dabble in programming language and type theory. My largest project has been [Roo](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/Roo), a compiler for a small programming language similar to Rust, written in C++.
