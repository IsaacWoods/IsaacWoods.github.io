I'm a 17 year-old student from the UK, interested in low-level programming, especially in Rust.

### OS Development
My main project is a [microkernel called Pebble](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/pebble), which is still in its early stages. I'm also a member of the [Rust OSDev](https://github.com/rust-osdev) organisation
and maintain the [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi) there, as well as contributing to some of the other projects hosted there.

### Teensy keyboard firmware
My side project at the moment is [teensy-kbd](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/teensy_kbd), a tiny firmware for mechanical keyboards using the Teensy 3.2. It's also written in Rust, and is very early in
development.

### Programming languages
I also dabble in programming language and type theory. My largest project was [Roo](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/Roo), a compiler for a small programming language similar to Rust, written in C++.
